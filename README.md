# BirdyBoard ðŸ¦œ

## What is BirdyBoard?

BirdyBoard is an open source Stepper Motor Controller Board powered by the Raspberry Pi Pico. BirdyBoard enables low-level control of stepper motors via the TMC2209 motor driver, making it possible to control the absolute position of gantry components without End Stop Switches. 

Create custom PCB modifications for creative projects with BirdyBoard.

## Creating Accessibility Despite Chip Shortages

BirdyBoard uses the RP2040 chip which is readily available even though the chip shortage (as of 2022) has rendered other chip options unavailable. The BirdyBoard allows for direct placement of the Pi Pico breakout board and TMC2209 breakout boards giving the reliability of a PCB without the need for complex or tedious soldering procedures for assembly.
